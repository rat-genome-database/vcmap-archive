Installation problems with third party jars
-----
When installing or upgrading new jars, there is a high potential for security
policies to break the installation.  The primary reason for this is a new
security policy put in place by Oracle (after the purchase of Sun in 2009),
that required all third party libraries to contain the attribute:

  Trusted-Library: true

or else they would be loaded in a new ClassLoader instance (and thus the classes
in this package would be unavailable to the other packages).  This is regardless
of whether or not the package has been signed by the same certificate!!


This causes an issue when upgrading packages or installing new ones, as they often
do not contain this attribute.  For example, the JavaHelp package does not contain
this attribute and probably never will as it is not under active development.  In
order to work around this issue, you must unjar the files in this package, modify
the manifest, repackage the files, and sign the new jar.  The entire process is as
follows:

  * jar xvf jh.jar
  * (edit META-INF/MANIFEST.MF to add the missing attribute)
  * jar cvfm jh.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF javax/ com/
  * jarsigner -keystore <keystore> jh.jar <alias>

Also, please keep in mind that the error message when this occurs is extremely
useless.  No where is it mentioned that the jar was loaded in a different
ClassLoader.  It simply will report a missing class file.

More information about this issue can be found on Oracle's website:

Conclusion
-----
*** Whenever you have problems with a missing class file, first check the package
*** for that file to ensure the Trusted-Library attribute exists!
