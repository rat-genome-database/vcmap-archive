        <h1>Hiding Data</h1>
            <p>This page tells how to hide data.  If you have hidden data that you would like to show again, visit 
               the <a href="showing.html">showing hidden data</a> page.</p>

        <h2>Hiding a Map</h2>
            <p>Hiding a map will make it temporarily hidden.  All of the loaded data (annotation, segments, etc.) will hide 
               along with the map.  It will be replaced by a vertical gray line.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by selecting a map.  If you need help doing this, visit the 
                    <a href"making-selections.html">making a selection</a> page and find the select a map section.

                <li>Select <em>&quot;Map -> Hide Selected&quot;</em> from the menu bar.

                <li>The selected map should now be hidden.  Your window should look like the picture below.<br/>
                    <b>Note: The gray bar will be in the same location as the map was.</b>

        <h2>Hiding Annotation</h2>
            <p>Hiding annotation will hide both the label and the bar indicating its position.</p>
            <div class="subheading">
                 <h3>Hide All Selected</h3>
                     <ol>

                             page if you need help on doing this.</li>
                         <li>After you have selected annotation, choose <em>&quot;Annotation -> Hide -> All Selected&quot;</em>
                             from the menu bar.
                             <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/hiding/annotation-hide-selected.png"></p></li>
                         <li>The selected annotation should now be hidden.  If all of the annotation on a map of a particular 
                             type is hidden as a result, the column label will also hide.</li>

                     <ol>
                         <li>First you need to select an interval.  This is done by clicking and dragging on a segment.  The 
                             selected interval will become shaded in green.  If additional maps are visible, the corresponding 
                             intervals on those maps will also be selected.<br/>

                                was drawn.</b></li>
                         <li>Choose <em>&quot;Annotation -> Hide -> All in Selected Intervals&quot;</em> from the menu bar.

                         <li>All annotation regardless of type that was in the selected interval should now be hidden.</li>

                         <li>Choose <em>&quot;Annotation -> Hide -> All of Type... -> ---------&quot;</em> from the menu.  Under 
                             <em>&quot;All of Type...&quot;</em> will be a listing of each type of annotation that is currently 
                             loaded on any map.

                         <li>Select the type of annotation you want to hide.</li>
                         <li>All annotation of the selected type will be hidden.  This includes every map that the annotation 
                             is loaded for.</li>
