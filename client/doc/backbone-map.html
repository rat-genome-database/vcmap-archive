  <h1>Backbone Maps</h1>
  <h4>What is a backbone map?</h4>
  <p>A backbone map is our term for the map that you have selected to serve as
    the primary map onto which all other maps are aligned.  For this reason,
    you are only able to load a single chromosome from the backbone map at one
    time.
  </p>
  <p>You can load another backbone map at any time, but this operation will
    replace anything that you currently have loaded into memory.  Alternatively,
    consider opening a new window and loading a new backbone map into the
    other window.
  </p>
  <p>In order to open a new window simply:
  <ul>
    <li>Click on "File...New Window" from the menubar</li>
    <li>Press <em>Ctrl+n</em> after selecting the main VCMap window</li>
  </ul>
