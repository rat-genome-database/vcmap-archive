        <h1>Loading Custom Annotation from GFF Files</h1>
            <p>Exporting an image can only be done what at least one map is loaded.  If you need to load a map, 
               consult the <a href="load-map.html">Load a Map</a> page for help on doing this.  When a map 
               is loaded the Export Image feature allows you to save the contents of the map window to an image file.

                <li>A <em>&quot;Save Image&quot;</em> dialog box will open up.  This dialog contains several different parts. 
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/save-image/save-dialog.png"></p></li>
                <li>The title text field, shown above in selection <b>A</b> allows you to give the image a title.  The title 
                    on the image is automatically is resized to fit.</li>
                <li>The watermark location radio buttons, shown in selection <b>B</b> above, allow you to choose where on the image
                    to place the VCMap logo.</li>
                <li>Selection <b>C</b> in the image above shows the path where the image will be saved.  Clicking on the path or the
                    <em>&quot;...&quot;</em> button opens up a <em>&quot;Save File As...&quot;</em> dialog box shown below.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/save-image/save-as.png"></p></li>
                <li>The drop down menu at the bottom of the dialog contains a list of all the files that can be written to.  When the
                    select button is chosen the file path will be updated to the new directory with the new file name.</li>
