        <h1>Changing Map Positions</h1>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Moving Maps</h2>
            <p>Maps can be moved around the VCMap window by clicking on the name of the map and dragging it 
               to the location you wish that map to be.  You will know you are dragging the map if there is 
               a blue outline of the map moving around as you move your mouse.  As you pass over other 
               maps, the window will update with the current location of the map you are dragging.  The map 
               will be placed as soon as you release the mouse button.</p>

        <h2>Restoring Default Ordering</h2>
            <p>Restoring the default ordering of the maps will undo any changes you have done to the order 
               of the maps.  By using this option, the map layout will revert back to the default order that the 
               maps were loaded.  This can be done by selecting <em>&quot;Map -> Restore Positions&quot;</em> 
               from the menu bar or by using the keyboard shortcut <em>&quot;CTRL + R&quot;</em>.<br/>
               <b>Note: The switch will happen immediately and there is no message asking for confirmation.</b></p>
