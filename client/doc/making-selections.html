        <h1>Make a Selection</h1>
        <p>Almost everything that you see in the VCMap window is able to be selected.  Selections will indicated 
           graphically in different ways depending on what has been selected.  There is also a selection bar at the 
           top of the screen that describes what the current selection is.</p>

        <a name="selectMap" />
        <h2>Selecting a Map</h2>
            <p>To select an entire map, click on the map's label located directly above the map.</p>

        <a name="selectSegment" />
        <h2>Selecting a Segment</h2>
            <p>To select a segment, click on the segment.  The segment's border will thicken to indicate 
               that it has been selected.  By default connecting lines will appear indicating where the features 
               of the selected segment lie on the adjacent maps.  The preferences menu contains options to
               show connections between non-adjacent maps also or to turn off the connecting lines completely.
               These lines will be gray in color.</p>

        <a name="selectAnnotation" />
        <h2>Selecting Annotation</h2>
            <p>Selecting annotation is done by clicking on the name of the annotation.  If an annotation is 
               part of a feature grouping, it can be selected by first clicking the group name and then selecting 
               the specific annotation.  When annotation is selected the label will turn blue, a corresponding area on 
               the chromosome will be shaded green, and connecting lines will be drawn at both the start and stop 
               positions if the annotation also is on an adjacent map.  Connecting lines can be altered with the 
               same preferences as for segments.</p>

            <p>Annotation can also be selected by clicking and dragging to highlight all the annotation of interest.</p>

            <div class="subheading">
                 <h3>Selection Bar Updates</h3>
                     <p>When only one annotation is selected the selection bar updates like it would for a segment or 
                        a map.</br>
                        <img class="screenshot" src="images/making-selections/annotation-selected.png"></p>
                     <p>When multiple annotation has been selected, the selection bar indicates how many pieces have 
                        been selected.  If a single annotation lies on multiple visible maps and is selected, it 
                        will be selected on all maps.</br>
                        (e.g. Annotation X is located on maps Y and Z and is selected from map Y.  X will also be 
                        selected from map Z for a total of 2 selected elements.)  To view the annotation information 
                        of the selection, click on the label pictured below.</br>

        <a name="selectInterval" />
        <h2>Selecting an Interval</h2>
            <p>To select an interval, use your mouse to click and drag an area on a segment.  The selected interval will 
               become shaded green in color.  The corresponding area on other loaded maps will also become selected.  In the 
               picture shown below, the interval was dragged on the left map.  The corresponding interval on the right map 
               also becomes selected.</p>
