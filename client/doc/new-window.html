  <h1>What to do Next?</h1>

  <p>Now that you have opened a new window you should notice that you have
    multiple main VCMap windows open.  The previous window will continue to
    maintain your previously loaded data, while this new window can load
    separate data including a different backbone map.  This setup should
    allow you to switch between two different views into the relationship
    between genomes and their features and can be very useful when
    interrogating complex relationships.

      Load a backbone map to begin investigating the relationships between
      different genomes and features of those genomes.
