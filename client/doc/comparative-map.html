  <h4>What is a comparative map?</h4>
  <p>A comparative (or off-backbone) map is a map that is loaded after you
    have already chosen a backbone map.  Because of this the chromosomes that
    will be loaded are determined by the regions of syteny as loaded into our
    database.  These regions of synteny will appear in the column for the
    comparative map, color coded by chromosome, along with their start and stop
    positions to the right of the chromosome segments.  Any annotation that 
    exists inside of these regions (in whole or in part) will appear to the 
    left of the segments.
  </p>
  <p>
    These regions of synteny are determined by the "Net - Level 1" conservation
    track at UCSC.
  </p>
  <p>You may notice that loading a comparative map takes longer than loading
    a backbone map.  This is because for every syntenic region on the backbone
    chromosome, we must load a new chromosome for the off-backbone map.  Due
    to the imprecise nature of the genetics of recombination and evolution,
    their is often a large number of small off-backbone segments that must be
    loaded.
