        <h1>Searching</h1>
            <p>Searching for features is done with a loaded map(s) and on the VCMap database.  If you need to load a map, 
               consult the <a href="load-map.html">Load a Map</a> page for help on doing this.

        <h2>How to Search</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by selecting <em>&quot;Search -> Find...&quot;</em> from the menu bar or by 
                    pressing <em>&quot;CTRL + F&quot;</em> on the keyboard.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/search/search-find.png"></p></li>
                <li>A <em>&quot;Find&quot;</em> dialog box will open up.  Now you have two options to search 
                    by:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Search by Name</li>
                        <li>Search by Loacation</li>
                        <li>Advanced Search</li>
                    </ul>
                    Depending on which way you want to search, follow the appropriate instructions below.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>VCMap Advanced Search</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>When the search dialog first appears your view should be what is shown below.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/search/advanced.png"></p></li>
                <li>Choose a type of filter using the left drop down menu. Depending on your selection a different 
                     type of search method will be added on the right side.  This is indicated in selection <b>B</b> in the image below.</li>
                <li>To add a search filter click the <em>&quot;+&quot;</em> button shown in selection <b>B</b> in the figure below.  This button
                	may be disabled if there are empty search filters.</li>
                <li>To remove a search filter click its <em>&quot;-&quot;</em> button on the left hand side.  This is shown in
                    selection <b>A</b> in the figure below.</li>
                <li>The <em>&quot;Match Any&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Match All&quot;</em> radio buttons, shown in selection <b>C</b> below 
                    allow you to either return results that match all of the search criteria, or to return results matching any of the 
                    search criteria.</li>
                <li>The database, all loaded maps, and thier hidden annotation will be searched.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/search/advanced-filters.png"></p></li>
                <li>The results of the search will be listed.  The order of the listing can be changed by clicking 
                    on the column names (Name, Type, Start, Stop, Chromosome, Map, Loaded).</li>
                <li>Results are marked in the <em>&quot;Loaded&quot;</em> column with <em>&quot;Yes&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;No&quot;</em>, or
                	<em>&quot;Yes (Hidden)&quot;</em>.  This column indicates if results have been already loaded into VCMap. Results that
                	have already been loaded are also bolded if they are visible and greyed out if they are hidden.<li>
                <li>The number of results returned from the loaded maps and the database will both be under the search bar.  You can 
                    click on the different results and the corresponding feature will be selected on the map.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/search/advanced-results.png"></p></li>
                <li>Double clicking on features from the database will bring up a dialog giving you the option to load the map associated
                    with that result.  A checkbox on the dialog enables you to load the map associated with the result as a backbone map.
                    Double clicking results that are hidden features on the map will bring up a dialog box allowing you to show that specific
                    annotation.  An image of the dialog box is shown below.

            </ol>

                 <h3>Notes:</h3>
                     <ul>
                         <li>&quot;<em>Feature Name</em>&quot; search terms are NOT case sensitive and they can be found at any point within the name.<br/>
                             e.g. a search for &quot;abc&quot; will match the following:
                             <ul>
                                 <li>ABC</li>
                                 <li>abc</li>
                                 <li>123Abc</li>
                                 <li>abc123</li>
                                 <li>123abcxyz</li>
                             </ul></li>
                     </ul>
                     <ul>
                         <li>For the &quot;<em>Location Search</em>&quot; filter, only features that fall completely within the start/stop range on the specified
                         	 chromosome will be found. The following example will explain what this means:
                             <div id="locationEx">
                                  <table id="locationTable">
                                         <tr><th>Name</th><th>Start</th><th>Stop</th></tr>
                                         <tr><td>A</td><td>5</td><td>15</td></tr>
                                         <tr><td>B</td><td>17</td><td>25</td></tr>
                                         <tr><td>C</td><td>13</td><td>19</td></tr>
                                  </table>
                                  <p id="locationP">A search is performed with the start and stop positions being 10 and 20 respectively.  
                                     C will be returned because its start and stop positions are both between 10 and 20.  Features A 
                                     and B will not be returned.  While A's stop and B's start positions do fall between the searched 
                                     values, A's start and B's stop positions do not and therefore these features will not be included 
                                     in the results of the search.</p></li>
                             </div>
                     </ul>
                     <ul>
                         <li>The &quot;<em>Location Search</em>&quot; filter supports the standard genomic coordinate notation used by UCSC.
                             To search a whole chromosome simply use <b><i>chrXX</i></b>, <b><i>chrXX</i>:</b> or <b><i>chrXX</i>:1-</b>, where
                             <i>chrXX</i> is the chromosome you wish to search. To search from a specified start location to the end of the chromosome
                             type <b><i>chrXX</i>:<i>start</i></b> or <b><i>chrXX</i>:<i>start</i>-</b>, where <i>chrXX</i> is the chromosome you wish to search and 
                             <i>start</i> is the starting location of the search.  Finally to search from a specific starting and stoping range type
                             <b><i>chrXX</i>:<i>start</i>-<i>stop</i></b>, where <i>chrXX</i> is the chromosome you wish to search, <i>start</i> is the starting 
                             location of the search, and <i>stop</i> is the ending location of the search.  An example search is shown below.
                             
                            <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/search/location-search.png"></p></li>

                         <li>To limit memory usage a maximum of 225,000 results will be loaded from the database.</li>
                         <li>The <em>&quot;Gene Name&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Location&quot;</em> filters work the same
                             as the individual <em>&quot;Name Search&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Location Search&quot;</em> tabs.</li>
                         <li>The add filter button will disable itself to prevent the addition of un-nessary addition of a
                             search filter (i.e. there is already an empty search filter). The button will re-enable itself Once
                             there are no empty filters.</li>
                         <li>Generic searches may take longer due to the large number of search results being returned.  Sorting operations
                             with large result sets may also take more time.</li>
                     </ul>
            </div>

        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To view the details of a <em>&quot;loaded&quot;</em> feature the search dialog must first be closed by clicking 
                    <em>&quot;Close&quot;</em> (search results will be cleared but the selected feature(s) will stay 
                    selected).  Once the dialog is closed, you can now view the details.  Instructions as to how can be found 
                    on the <a href="view-details.html">view details</a> page.</li>
                <li>A non backbone map will contain only segments of the chromosome.  Only the loaded segments 
                    will be returned as <em>&quot;loaded&quot;</em> results searched.</li>
            </ul>
