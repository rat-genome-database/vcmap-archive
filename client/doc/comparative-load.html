  <h1>What to do Next?</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Now that you have successfully loaded multiple maps, you may:
   <ol>
     <li><a href="load-annotation.html">Load Annotation:</a>
       Loading annotation data will display additionally features on all of the
       maps that you have loaded so far.  You can load this data and explore
       the relationships between these features and where they exist on each
       map.
     </li>
     <li><a href="making-selections.html">Selecting Annotation:</a>
       Features that have been identified as homologous features will display
       a connecting line between maps.  When you select one of these features,
       the homologous features on other maps will be selected at the same time.
     </li>
     <li><a href="download.html">Downloading Information:</a>
       You can selectively download information from VCMap and open it in a
       spreadsheet application like Microsoft Excel.  Follow these instructions
       to select a group of annotation and download filtered data in a 
       personally customized format to your system's default spreadsheet
       application.
     </li>
   </ol>
