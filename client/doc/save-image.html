        <h1>Exporting an Image to a File</h1>
            <p>Exporting an image can only be done what at least one map is loaded.  If you need to load a map, 
               consult the <a href="load-map.html">Load a Map</a> page for help on doing this.  When a map 
               is loaded the Export Image feature allows you to save the contents of the map window to an image file.

                <li>The title text field, shown above in selection <b>A</b> allows you to give the image a title.  The title

                    select button is chosen the file path will be updated to the new directory with the new file name.</li>
