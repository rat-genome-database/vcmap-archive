        <h2>Downloading Annotation Information</h2>
            <p>Only loaded annotation can be downloaded so before you follow the steps, make sure that 
               everything you want to download is loaded.  For help on loading a map visit the 
               <a href="load-map.html">load a map</a> page and for help on loading annotation visit the 
               <a href="load-annotation.html">load annotation</a> page.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by selecting an interval.  If you need help with this step, refer to the 
                    <a href="making-selections.html">make a selection</a> page and scroll to the section 
                    about selecting an interval.</li>
                <li>Open up the download dialog box.  This is done  by selecting <em>&quot;File -> Download...&quot;</em> 
                    from the menu or by pressing <em>&quot;Ctrl + D&quot;</em> on the keyboard.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/download/file-download.png"></p></li>
                <li>When the download dialog box opens up, it will contain four sections: <em>&quot;Interval Info&quot;</em>, 
                    <em>&quot;Annotation Selection&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;Show/Hide Data&quot;</em>, and 
                    <em>&quot;Preview&quot;</em>.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/download/download-dialog.png"></p></li>
                <li>The <em>&quot;Interval Info&quot;</em> section tells you what intervals have been selected.  From 
                    this section choose which intervals you want to be included in your downloaded file.  To choose an 
                    individual interval simply click on it, or you can choose all of the intervals by pushing the 
                    <em>&quot;Select All&quot;</em> button in that section.  The chosen intervals will be highlighted.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/download/interval-info.png"></p></li>
                <li>The <em>&quot;Annotation Selection&quot;</em> section lets you choose the type(s) of annotation to 
                    be included.  From this section choose which annotation type you want in the file or push the 
                    <em>&quot;Select All&quot;</em> button in that section to choose all types of annotation.  The chosen 
                    types of annotation will be highlighted.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/download/annotation-selection.png"></p></li>
                <li>The <em>&quot;Show/Hide Data&quot;</em> section is where you can choose what information you want to 
                    be saved.  The <em>&quot;Hidden Data&quot;</em> column contains the information that will not be included 
                    in the file.  The <em>&quot;Shown Data&quot;</em> column contains the information that will be in the 
                    file.  The arrow buttons are for moving the information between the two columns.
                    <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/download/data-selection.png"></p></li>
                <li>To move data from hidden to shown and vice versa, click on the data name (it will become highlighted) and 
                    push the arrow pointing toward the column where you want the data to be.  The data will switch columns.<br/>
                    <b>Note: The order of the data in the <em>&quot;Shown Data&quot;</em> column will be the order in which the 
                    data appears in the file.</b></li>
                <div class="subheading">
                     <h3>Preview Section</h3>
                         <p>The <em>&quot;Preview&quot;</em> section will dynamically update as you are making your choices 
                            described in steps 4, 5, and 6, above.  It will contain a representative view of what the file 
                            would contain given the chosen information.</p>
                         <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/download/preview.png"></p>
                </div>
                <li>Now once you have made all the selections you want, press the <em>&quot;Open&quot;</em> button.  This 
                    will open up the default spreadsheet editor program with the data in the cells.  The file that is 
                    opened up is a temporary comma separated values (.csv) file.<br/>
                    <b>Note: The .csv file has not been saved yet.  If you want to save the file, it must be done from 
                    within the spreadsheet program.</b></li>
