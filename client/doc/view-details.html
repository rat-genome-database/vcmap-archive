        <h2>Annotation Details</h2>
            <p>VCMap has an <em>&quot;Annotation Details&quot;</em> dialog box that contains additional 
               information about annotation.  This can be accessed in any of four ways:
               <ol>
                   <li>Double clicking on an annotation label.  If the annotation is in a feature grouping 
                       then you need to first click on the grouping and then double click on the label.
                       <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/view-details/double-click.png"</p></li>
                   <li>Pressing the <em>&quot;Details&quot;</em> button located in the top right corner.
                       <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/view-details/details-button.png"></p></li>
                   <li>Pressing <em>&quot;Ctrl + T&quot;</em> on the keyboard.</li>
                   <li>Choosing <em>&quot;Annotation -> View Details...&quot;</em> from the menu.
                       <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/view-details/annotation-details.png"</p></li>
               </ol>
               <b>Note: Steps 2, 3, and 4 above require that 
                  <a href="making-selections.html">annotation be selected</a> first.</b><br/><br/>
               If multiple pieces of annotation are selected, the dialog will contain information about 
               every selected piece.  Each different annotation will have its own tab.  If an annotation 
               is found on multiple loaded maps, it can be viewed by using the <em>&quot;Homologous Genes&quot;</em> 
               drop down menu within the <em>&quot;Annotation Details&quot;</em> dialog.  Even more additional 
               information can be viewed by using the links found in the in the lower left corner.  These links 
               will open up the webpage for the source that the data was gathered from.</p>
