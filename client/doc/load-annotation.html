        <h1>Loading Annotation</h1>
        <p>Annotation can only be loaded after at least one map has been loaded.  If you need to load a map,
           you can follow the instructions on how to <a href="load-map.html">Load a Map</a>.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>How to Load Annotation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To load annotation select, <em>&quot;Annotation -> Load Annotation...&quot;</em> from the menu 
                or use the keyboard shortcut <em>&quot;Ctrl + A&quot;</em>.
                <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/load-annotation/annotation-loadAnnotation.png"></p></li>
            <li>When the <em>&quot;Load Annotation&quot;</em> dialog box opens, select the type of annotation you
                wish to load from the drop down menu pictured below.
                <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/load-annotation/type-of-annotation.png"></p></li>
            <li>After you have chosen which type of annotation you want to load, you need to choose which map(s) 
                you would like to load annotation for.  By default VCMap will load the annotation for each map you 
                currently have loaded (even if the map is hidden).  If you are going to load the annotation for all
                of the maps, continue to step 5.<br/>
                <b>Note: Not all types of annotation will be available for every map.  The maps listed are the maps for which 
                the current type of annotation can be loaded for.</b></li>
            <li>The loaded maps will initially all be selected.  To load annotation for only one map, click on the map.  The chosen 
                map name will be highlighted.  To load annotation for multiple maps, the <em><b>Ctrl</b></em> key needs to 
                be pressed.  While holding the <em><b>Ctrl</b></em> key, use the mouse to toggle (between selected and not 
                selected) which maps annotation will be loaded for.  The maps will toggle by simply clicking on the name 
                while the <em><b>Ctrl</b></em> key is pressed. A map is chosen when its name is highlighted.<br/>
                <b>Note: Not all types of annotation will be available for every map.  The maps listed are the maps for which 
                the current type of annotation can be loaded for.</b><br/>

                </div>
                <div class="clear" /></li>
            <li>If you are not loading QTL data then click the <em>&quot;Load&quot;</em> button to load the annotation you have chosen.  If 
                you are loading QTL data, continue on to step 6.<br/>
                <b>Note: Once the dialog box closes, it will take a few moments fot the annotation to load.</b></li>
            <li>When loading QTL data, you have the option to apply ontology filters to the data.  The drop down menu lists 
                all of the ontology filters.  Terms that are in black with a number next to them are filters that can be loaded 
                for the maps selected in steps 3 and 4 above (the numbers indicate how many pieces of annotation are under the filter).  
                Terms in gray are filters that are available on a different chromosome of the selected map(s).  (Available filters 
                will always be listed at the top of the list.  Unavailable filters will be at the bottom)

                <img class="screenshot" src="images/load-annotation/ontology-filter2.png"></p></li>
            <li>Chosen filters will be listed in a tree structure under the drop down menu.  The drop down menu will change 
                update to reflect which filters have been selected.  It will contain subcategories of the previously chosen filters.<br/>
                <b>Note: There will be a varying amount of subcategories depending on which filters are chosen.</b>
                <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/load-annotation/ontology-tree.png"></p></li>
        </ol>        
        <hr/>
        <h3>Additional QTL Information:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Filters can be removed from the selection by using the tree.  Clicking on the filter you wish to go back to 
                will remove all filters that are subcategories of it.</li>
            <li>You can load at any time.  Clicking <em>&quot;Load&quot;</em> will load all data that is a subcategory of the 
                last chosen filter.  You do not need to choose subcategories until there are no more to choose.</li>
            <li>Loading all available QTL data is done when <em>&quot;All Data&quot;</em> is the only item in the tree.</li>
            <li>After QTL has been loaded and is visible on the map, you can check which filters have been loaded on a 
                particular map by clicking on the <em>&quot;QTL&quot;</em> label above the column.

                   <img class="screenshot" src="images/load-annotation/qtl-listing.png"</p>
                <b>Note: Even if no QTL exists on a map but was chosen to be loaded for it, it will be in the list.  In the 
                   above picture, a Bos Tauraus map is also loaded.  The &quot;production&quot; filter was chosen to be 
                   loaded for both maps.  This filter only exists on Bos Taurus but since it was chosen to be loaded for the 
                   Homo Sapiens map also, it appears in the listing.</b></li>
        </ul>
