        <h1>Interaction between maps</h1>

        <h2>The Backbone Map</h2>
            <p>The backbone map is the map to which all additional maps align to.  It will be the first map that 
               gets loaded.  In addition to saying what species and map, the label will also say <em>&quot;backbone&quot;</em>
               and which chromosome it is.

            </p>

        <hr/>
        <h2>The Off-backbone Map</h2>
            <p>The off-backbone map will be any maps loaded that are not a backbone map.  These maps will contain segments of 
               different chromosomes from the same map release.  The software determines which segments align with the backbone 
               map and displays them accordingly.  Each segment will contain the number indicating which chromosome it is from
               and will be colored.  Some segments however may be too small to for the number to be displayed but they will still 
               be colored correctly (if you zoom in the number will appear when the segment becomes large enough).  The segments 
               will also be diplayed on the backbone map.  The segments will be half the width of the map and will be colored 
               according to which chromosome they are.  This helps to see the positioning of the segments as it relates to the 
               backbone map.</p>

        <h2>Interactions</h2>
            <p>Listed below are a few of the things you can do.</p>
            
            <div class="subheading">
              <h3>Search</h3>
                  <p>You can search for any data that is loaded.  Use this feature if you are looking for a particular piece of data 
                     but you do not know where it is.  Refer to the <a href="search.html">search</a> page for more on how to do this.</p>
            
              <h3>Download</h3>
                  <p>You can download the information that you have loaded to a file.  Refer to the <a href="download.html">download</a> 
                     page for more on how to do this.</p>

              <h3>Selecting</h3>
                  <p>You can select specific pieces on annotation, groups of annotation, or even entire segments.  When any of these 
                     are done connecting lines will be drawn between maps indicating where the annotation is located on each map.  
                     For more on selecting, refer to the <a href="making-selections.html">making selections</a> page.</p>
