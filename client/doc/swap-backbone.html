        <h1>Swap Backbones</h1>
        <p>Swap backbones allows you to change which map is the backbone map.  The choices are any off-backbone 
           map that is loaded.  When an off-backbone map is loaded it is aligned to the backbone map.  Swapping 
           backbones allows you to view the same data but with respect to a different backbone map.  All of the 
           data that is previously loaded will be reloaded to align to the new backbone.  The new backbone map 
           will be opened in a new window and the original window will stay open also.</p>

        <h2>How to Swap Backbones</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Select <em>&quot;Map -> Swap Backbones...&quot;</em> or use the keyboard shortcut 
                <em>&quot;CTRL + B&quot;</em>.
                <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/swap-backbone/map-swapbackbone.png"></p></li>
            <li>If you have only 2 maps loaded, VCMap will make the swap automatically.  The new backbone map will 
                be the previously loaded off-backbone map.  Continue on to the next step.  If you have more than 
                two maps loaded, a dialog box will appear asking which off-backbone map you would like to become 
                the new backbone map.  Make a choice in the drop down menu and click <em>&quot;OK&quot;</em>.
                <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/swap-backbone/choose-backbone.png"></p></li>
            <li>A new VCMap window will open along with a dialog box labeled <em>&quot;Swapping Backbone&quot;</em>.  
                The box will ask you to choose which chromosome you wish to load as the new backbone map.  Your 
                choices however will be limited to only chromosomes that were loaded on the off-backbone map.  
                The chromosomes will be in a drop down menu.  Pick the chromosome you want and then click 
                <em>&quot;OK&quot;</em>.<br/>
                <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/swap-backbone/choose-chromosome.png"></p></li>
                <b>Note: To load a chromosome that is not listed, please consult the 
                <a href="load-map.html">Load a Map</a> page.</b>
        </ol>
        <hr/>
        <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It is possible that the new backbone map will not align correctly to one or more loaded maps.  
                If this is the case, VCMap will give a warning message indicating that no data has been loaded 
                for the map.</li>
            <li>The original window will remain open.  The new backbone map will be loaded into its own separate 
                window.</li>
            <li>While the swap is taking place, the new window will appear blank.  Be patient as it takes 
                a few moments for the new data to load.</li>
        </ul>
