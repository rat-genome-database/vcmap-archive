        <h2>Showing a Map</h2>
            <p>There are 3 ways to show hidden maps:</p>
            <div class="subheading">
                 <h3>Double Clicking</h3>
                     <p>When a map is hidden, it will be replaced by a vertical, gray bar.  Double click 
                        anywhere on this bar and the map will be shown where the gray bar was.</p>
                 <h3>Showing a Single Hidden Map</h3>
                     <p>This method is used when you want to show only one hidden map.</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Select the hidden map you want to show.  This is done by single clicking 
                             on the gray bar.  You will know you have selected the map by looking at the 
                             selection bar.  It will display information about the map when it has been 
                             selected.</li>
                         <li>Now that you have selected a map, choose <em>&quot;Map -> Show Selected&quot;</em>
                             from the menu.
                             <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/showing/map-showSelected.png"></p></li>
                         <li>The map will be shown where the gray bar was.
                     </ol>
                 <h3>Showing all Hidden Maps</h3>
                     <p>When you have multiple hidden maps and you would like to show them all, use this method.</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Choose <em>&quot;Map -> Show All&quot;</em> from the menu.
                             <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/showing/map-showAll.png"></p></li>
                         <li>Every map that was hidden will now be shown.</li>
                     </ol>
                 <h3>Notes:</h3>
                     <ul>
                         <li>Showing a hidden map will show all of the annotation that was loaded for it including 
                             annotation that was hidden when the map was hidden.</li>
            </div>
        <a name="showAnnotation" />
        <hr/>
        <h2>Showing Annotation</h2>
            <p>The are 3 ways to show annotation:</p>
            <div class="subheading">
                 <h3>Show All Hidden Annotation</h3>
                     <p>Select <em>&quot;Annotation -> Show -> All&quot;</em> from the menu.  This will show every 
                        annotation that has been hidden regardless of what type it is and what map it is on.</p>
                     <p><img class="screehshot" src="images/showing/annotation-show-all.png"></p>
                 <h3>Show All in Selected Interval</h3>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Select an interval on the map.  This is done by clicking and draging on a segment.  The 
                             interval selected will become shaded in green.  If there are multiple maps visible, the 
                             corresponding interval(s) on them will also be selected.
                             <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/showing/selected-interval.png"></p></li>
                         <li>Next you need to choose <em>&quot;Annotation -> Show -> All in Selected Intervals&quot;</em> 
                             from the menu.
                             <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/showing/annotation-show-interval.png"></p></li>
                         <li>Any annotation that crosses into the selected interval(s) and is currently hidden will be shown.</li>
                     </ol>
                 <h3>Show All of the same Type</h3>
                     <p>Choose <em>&quot;Annotation -> Show -> All of Type... -> -----&quot;</em> from the menu.  Under 
                        <em>&quot;All of Type...&quot;</em> will be a listing of annotation types that have been loaded.  
                        Select on from the list to have that type shown on all maps.</p>
                     <p><img class="screenshot" src="images/showing/annotation-show-type.png"></p>

            </div>
